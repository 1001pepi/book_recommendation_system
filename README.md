# book_recommendation_system

In this project, we are going to build a book recommendation system. For that, we kneed the list of the books we like and the data on books rating on which we will base our recommendations.

# Project steps

The different steps of the project are as follow:

+ Search for books: get the id of a book using it title
+ Create book list: the list of the book we like. That will be done using the previous search engine.
+ Recommend Books: somehow the main step of the project.
